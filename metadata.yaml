description: '"Dave stared around the office. He went to the window and stared upwards
  at the crazy patchwork of the sky. For all he knew, in such a sky there might be
  cracks. In fact, as he looked, he could make out a rift, and beyond that a ... hole
  ... a small patch where there was no color, and yet the sky there was not black.
  There were no stars there, though points of light were clustered around the edges,
  apparently retreating.''"'
